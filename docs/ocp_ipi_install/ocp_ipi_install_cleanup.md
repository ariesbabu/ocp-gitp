## Deploying OCP Cluster  

This will be simplest part of all, provided you have done everything correctly to this point. 

1. Start the installation of OCP cluster by executing the following

    ```mdx-code-block
    <details>
    <summary>Would you like to see verbose installation logs?</summary>
    <div>
    <body>

    Run the following command to start the installation of OCP cluster with verbose logging.
 
    ```bash 
    nohup openshift-install create cluster --log-level=debug &
    ```
    </body>
    </div>
    </details>
    
    ```bash 
    nohup openshift-install create cluster &
    ```
    ```bash title="Now you can follow the nohup logs to see installation progress"
    tail -f nohup.out
    ```

2. A typical installation flow would look like this
   
   :::caution

   This steps will take up to 40 minutes.

   ```buttonless {16,18} title="Install output - note the access information to the OCP cluster"
   openshift-install create cluster

   INFO Login to the console with user: "kubeadmin", and password: "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx" 
   INFO Time elapsed: 27m0s
   ```
3. Once the installation is done we can access OCP cluster using the following ways:

    ```text title="Export your kubeconfig file to env"
    export KUBECONFIG=/home/ubuntu/auth/kubeconfig
    ```

    ```bash
    oc get nodes
    ##
    NAME                     STATUS   ROLES    AGE     VERSION
    xyz-6zlwh-master-0       Ready    master   14m   v1.24.0+b62823b
    xyz-6zlwh-master-1       Ready    master   14m   v1.24.0+b62823b
    xyz-6zlwh-master-2       Ready    master   14m   v1.24.0+b62823b
    xyz-6zlwh-worker-czbn7   Ready    worker   14m   v1.24.0+b62823b
    xyz-6zlwh-worker-njv66   Ready    worker   14m   v1.24.0+b62823b
    xyz-6zlwh-worker-mlgbh   Ready    worker   14m   v1.24.0+b62823b
    ```

   Through the OCP GUI using kubeadmin credentials

   From your UserXX-WindowsToolsPC, open Chrome

   Open the following URL
   
   ```url
   https://console-openshift-console.apps.xyz.ntnxlab.local
   ```
   ![](images/ipi-installed-cluster.png)
   
   You have sucessfully installed OCP using IPI.

:::note

Now that you have finished OCP IPI install, you can move on to the **OCP Command Access** section and then on to workloads section.

:::


## Cleanup (optional)

:::danger DO NOT Cleanup UNLESS .. 

Cleaning up (deleting) the OCP cluster should be done only in the following circumstances:

- You have finished all the labs.
- You have run into issues deploying OCP cluster and you would like to clean up the resources before redeploying OCP cluster.

:::

Run through the following if you would like to delete the OCP cluster. 

1. In your UserXX-LinuxToolsVM 

2. Change to you working directory that we created before (if not there already)

   ```bash
   cd /ubuntu/xyz
   ```

3. Clean up with the following command:

   ```bash
   openshift-install destroy cluster 
   ```

IPI installation method is simple and consistent to deploy as after the pre-requisites are setup once.

Customers can easily deploy as many OCP clusters on Nutanix HCI.
