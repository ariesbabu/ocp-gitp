# OCP: Assisted Installation

In this optional lab we will go through Assisted Installation feature that Red Hat Console offers.

Assisted Installer is a GUI driven way of deploying OCP clusters.

You would use Assisted Installer clusters for to deploy OCP clusters quickly (e.g. before a POC) and for personal testing purposes.

Single node OCP cluster implementation is also available with Assisted Installer. We will only look at deploying multi-node clusters in this lab.

:::note

Estimated time to complete this lab is 60 minutes.

:::

:::caution 

If you are doing this section of the lab using a Single Node HPOC (SPOC) there will not be enough resources to deploy a second OCP cluster. 

Remove existing OCP clusters that you don't require anymore.

If you were using NCM (Calm) - Please delete the other OCP cluster(s) from **Calm > Actions > Delete** before proceeding with this lab.

:::

## Pre-requisites for Assisted Installation

-   Administrator finds and reserves API and Ingress IP addresses for OCP cluster 
-   Administrator creates the OCP Master and Worker VMs
-   Adminsitrator provisions compute, networking and storage associated with the OCP Master and Worker VMs
-   Access to Red Hat Console to use Assisted Installer and install a OCP cluster

## High Level Overview of Assisted Installation

Assisted Installer does the following:

-   Provides RHCOS and OCP installation binaries in a CD-ROM ISO file
-   Once the OCP VMs (Master and Worker) nodes are booted with this CD-ROM ISO file, using the public key the VMs connect to Red Hat Console
-   VMs show in Assisted Installer page and the administrator (you) begins the installation
-   Red Hat Console will manage and monitor the installation process from start to end
-   Upon successfull installatino of a OCP cluster the following will be
    provided:
    -   KUBECONFIG file for `oc` access
    -   DNS entries for OCP Cluster Manager access
-   Assisted installer will choose one of the Master VMs to serve the Bootstrap role

:::info

Assisted Installers in GA as of July 2022 [General Availability](https://cloud.redhat.com/blog/openshift-assisted-installer-is-now-generally-available) .

The OCP clusters deployed using Assisted Installers can be used for production, testing and development purposes owing to [pre-requisites](https://cloud.redhat.com/blog/using-the-openshift-assisted-installer-service-to-deploy-an-openshift-cluster-on-metal-and-vsphere#:~:text=Pre%2Drequisites,required%20for%20accessing%20the%20cluster) conformity.

:::

At a very high level, we will accomplish the following to get a OCP cluster deployed using Assisted Installer:

1.  Find and reserve two IPs in our AHV network for OCP cluster's API and Ingress endpoints
2.  Provision OCP Cluster in Red Hat Console and Generate CD-ROM ISO URL
3.  Provision OCP Infrastructure - Create Master and Worker VMs in your
    AHV HPOC/SPOC cluster using Terraform infrastructure as code
4.  Install OCP Cluster in Red Hat Console

## OCP Assisted Installation

### Pre-requisites

#### AHV Networking 

We will first find two IPs for OCP ``api`` and ``apps`` ingress endpoints in our network and add it to the **Primary** IPAM network blacklist. 

1. Find the CIDR range for your  **Primary** IPAM network either from [RX](https://rx.corp.nutanix.com/) or from your instrutor

   ```buttonless title="CIDR example for your Nutanix cluster"
   10.38.18.192/26
   ```

2. Logon to your UserXX-LinuxToolsVM (deployed on the HPOC cluster) using Mac Terminal or Windows Putty 

   > **Username**: root

   > **Password**: nutanix default 

3. Prepare the UserXX-LinuxToolsVM 
   
   ```bash
   yum update -y
   yum install -y bind-utils nmap
   ```

3. Find two unused static IP addresses

   ```bash
   nmap -v -sn  <your CIDR>
   ```
   ```bash title="Sample command"
   nmap -v -sn 10.38.18.192/26

   ```
   ```buttonless {1,2} title="Sample output - choose the first two consecutive IPs"
   Nmap scan report for 10.38.18.219 [host down] 
   Nmap scan report for 10.38.18.220 [host down]
   Nmap scan report for 10.38.18.221
   Host is up (-0.098s latency).
   ```

2. Logon to any CVM in your cluster and execute the following to add chosen static IPs to the **Primary** IPAM network

   - Username: nutanix
   - Password: your cluster password 
   
   ```bash
   acli net.add_to_ip_blacklist <your-ipam-ahv-network> ip_list=10.38.18.219,10.38.18.220
   ```
   ```bash title="Sample command"
   acli net.add_to_ip_blacklist Primary ip_list=10.38.18.219,10.38.18.220
   ```

#### Add DNS Records

In this section we will add PC, API and APPS Ingress DNS records for lookup by OCP IPI installer.

Your OCP cluster's name becomes a subdomain in your DNS zone ``ntnxlab.local``. All OCP cluster related lookups are located within subdomain.

- Main domain -  ``ntnxlab.local`` (this gets created with your HPOC reservation)
  - Sub domain - ``ocpuserXX.ntnxlab.local`` (e.g. ocpuser01, ocpuser02, etc, is your OCP cluster's name)

1. Logon to the AutoAD windows VM 

   > **Username**: administrator

   > **Password**: default

2. We will add the following entries to DNS server using the two consecutive IPs you found in the previous section
   
   :::danger Use your assigned HPOC cluster's IP Addresses

   The IP addresses in the following commands are used as an example. You should use IP address details that belong to your HPOC cluster. 
   
   For information on locating your cluster IP see [Lookup](https://lookup.howntnx.win) website.
   
   :::
   
   ```buttonless
   10.38.18.219   api.ocpuserXX.ntnxlab.local
   10.38.18.220   *.apps.ocpuserXX.ntnxlab.local
   10.38.18.201   pc.ntnxlab.local
   ```

2. Open PowerShell as Administrator and create the two A records

    ```mdx-code-block
    <Tabs>
    <TabItem value="Template commands">
    ```
    ```PowerShell title="Add the API A record - use your own subdomain"
    Add-DnsServerResourceRecordA -Name api.<ocpuserXX> -IPv4Address <your API IP> -ZoneName ntnxlab.local -ZoneScope ntnxlab.local
    ```
    ```PowerShell title="Add the apps Ingress A record - use your own subdomain"
    Add-DnsServerResourceRecordA -Name *.apps.<ocpuserXX> -IPv4Address <your Ingress IP> -ZoneName ntnxlab.local -ZoneScope ntnxlab.local 
    ```
    ```PowerShell title="Add the Prism Central A record"
    Add-DnsServerResourceRecordA -Name pc -IPv4Address <your PC IP> -ZoneName ntnxlab.local -ZoneScope ntnxlab.local 
    ```
    ```mdx-code-block
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="Sample commands">
    ``` 
    ```buttonless title="Sample commands with 'ocpuser01' as a subdomain and your OCP cluster name"
    Add-DnsServerResourceRecordA -Name api.ocpuser01 -IPv4Address 10.38.18.219 -ZoneName ntnxlab.local -ZoneScope ntnxlab.local
    Add-DnsServerResourceRecordA -Name *.apps.ocpuser01 -IPv4Address 10.38.18.220 -ZoneName ntnxlab.local -ZoneScope ntnxlab.local 
    ```
    ```PowerShell title="Add the Prism Central A record"
    Add-DnsServerResourceRecordA -Name pc -IPv4Address 10.38.18.201 -ZoneName ntnxlab.local -ZoneScope ntnxlab.local
    ```
    ```mdx-code-block
    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>
    ```

3. Test name resolution for added entries

   ```PowerShell {6}
   nslookup api.ocpuser01.ntnxlab.local
   Server: dc.ntnxlab.local
   Address: 10.38.18.203

   Name: api.ocpuser01.ntnxlab.local
   Address: 10.38.18.219 
   ```
   ```bash {6}
   nslookup myapp.apps.ocpuser01.ntnxlab.local
   Server: dc.ntnxlab.local
   Address: 10.38.18.203

   Name: myapp.apps.ocpuser01.ntnxlab.local
   Address: 10.38.18.220
   ```
   ```bash {6}
   nslookup pc.ntnxlab.local
   Server: dc.ntnxlab.local
   Address: 10.38.18.203

   Name: pc.ntnxlab.local
   Address: 10.38.3.201
   ```

### Provision OCP Infrastructure

This section of the lab is done on using Linux Tools VM.

If it is not already present in your HPOC, create Linux Tools VM using instructions in create Linux Tools VM lab.

:::note

You are able to create these VMs and its resources using the Prism Element GUI. But in this section we will use **Terraform** code for repeatability and ease.

:::

We will create the following resources:
  
| OCP Role   |    Operating System    |    vCPU    |  RAM         | Storage   | IOPS |           
| -------------|  ---------------------- |  -------- | ----------- |  --------- |  -------- | 
| Master   x 3    |  RHCOS                 |  4        | 16 GB      |  100 GB   |  300 | 
| Worker     x 2  |  RHCOS, RHEL 7.9, or RHEL 8.4  |  8  |  16 GB      |  100 GB |    300 | 


1.  Login to the Linux Tools VM using the following credentials

    -   **Username** - root
    -   **Password** - nutanix default

2.  Run the following commands in sequence

    ``` bash
    yum update -y 
    yum install -y yum-utils
    yum-config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/RHEL/hashicorp.repo
    yum -y install terraform
    yum -y install git
    ```

3.  Clone the following git repo and initialise Terraform provider

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nutanix-japan/tf-ocp-infra
    cd tf-ocp-infra
    alias "tf=terraform" 
    tf init
    ```

4.  Get your variables file ready with your HPOC/SPOC environment
    information

    ```bash
    cp terraform.tfvars.sample terraform.tfvars
    ```

5.  Modify your variables to suit your HPOC environment using `vi` or `nano` editor

    ``` bash
    vi terraform.tfvars
    ```
    ```mdx-code-block
    <Tabs>
    <TabItem value="Template file">

    nutanix_virtual_machine.RHCOS-worker[0] # < This is worker vm 1
    nutanix_virtual_machine.RHCOS-worker[1] # < This is worker vm 2
    ```

8.  Login to **Prism Element** > **VM** and verify the VMs and if they are powered on

    ![](images/ocp_tf_vms.png)

# Install OCP Cluster in Red Hat Console

In this section we will use Red Hat Console's Assisted Installer wizard to install the OCP cluster with the VMs we have provisioned.

1.  Return to Red Hat Openshift Console and check if the VMs appear
    (this may take up to 5 minutes)

    ![](images/ocp_rh_console_vms.png)

5.  In the **Host inventory** section, choose the following:
    
    - **Control Plane Node** for Master VMs (the 3 Master VMs) and
    - **Worker** nodes for Worker VMs from the drop-down menu (the 2 Worker VMs)

    ![](images/ocp_node_roles.png)

2.  Click **Next** at the bottom of the page 

3.  In the Storage section, after confirming disk size, click **Next** at the bottom of the page 

4.  In the Networking section, choose **Open Virtual Networking (OVN)** 
    
    Assign IPs for your **API Virtual IP** and **Ingress Virtual IP** from you HPOC/SPOC **Primary** network pool that you reserved earlier in the [AHV Networking](#ahv-networking) section. 

    ![](images/ocp_ing_api_ips.png)

6.  Click **Next** at the bottom of the page

7.  Review your setup information and click on **Install Cluster**

    ![](images/ocp_cluster_summary.png)

8.  You will be taken to monitoring your installation progress

    ![](images/ocp_install_start.png)

    Now the cluster deploy will proceed

9.  Watch for any messages about user interactions in the progress page

    ![](images/ocp_user_inter.png)

10. This message is wanting the user to unmount the installation Discovery ISO so they VM can boot into the OS drive

11. Go to **Prism Element** > **VM** > **Master/Worker VM** > **update**

12. Under Disks > Click on Eject

    ![](images/pe_vm_cd_eject.png)

13. Click on Save

14. Under **Power Off Actions** choose to Guest Reboot the VM where there are pending user action

15. Repeat ejecting CD-ROM for all VMs and rebooting it as the Wizard prompts for user action (do not do this before the prompting)

16. Once all the user actions are sustained for Master and Worker VMs, OCP cluster will be installed

17. Make sure to do the following:

    - Download ``kubeconfig`` file
    - Note down kubeadmin user ``password``
    - Note down the URL of the installed OCP cluster ``URL``

    ![](images/ocp_install_finish.png)

    :::note

    This ocp cluster console URL can **only** be accessed within your HPOC/SPOC environment

    :::

18. Copy/`scp` the contents of ``kubeconfig`` file to your UserXX-LinuxToolsVM
    
    ```bash title="Download and install oc command"
    curl -LO https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/x86_64/clients/ocp/stable/openshift-client-linux.tar.gz
    tar xvfz openshift-client-linux.tar.gz
    cp oc kubectl /usr/local/bin/
    ```
    ```bash
    export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/kubeconfig-file
    oc get nodes
    # You are all set
    ```

You have successfully deployed a OCP cluster using Red Hat Console Assisted Installer.
## Takeaways

-   You can easily deploy multinode/single node OCP cluster using the Red Hat console
-   You can provision resoruces (VM, Storage, etc) on Nutanix using Terraform IaaC (GitOps)
    
    :::info

    The Installer Provisioned Installer (IPI) also uses Terraform to deploy infrastructure assets (VM) on Nutanix and VMware

    :::

-   Assisted Installer provisioned OCP clusters can be used as a learning ground and for testing purposes

:::note

Now that you have finished Assisted install, you can move on to the **OCP Command Access** section and then on to workloads section.
